My research interests are centered around Computer Vision and Deep Learning, particularly deep generative models. My recent works focus on image generation and manipulation based on diffusion probabilistic models and energy-based models.

> There's too many problems. So how can you work on all problems simultaneously? You solve the meta-problem, which is to me just intelligence and how do you automate it? - Andrej Karpathy

### Personal logs: 
- This is my fourth time resolving a bug in the long run üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüèÉ, as well as medium-difficulty problems such as "How to work effectively with a large codebase?" and "Preparing an agenda and good questions for my presentation." I am still figuring out how to reproduce the phenomenon. My main strategies include: (1) Loading my mental RAM (my working memory) fully with the problem, be obsessed with it when I'm taking a shower, and falling asleep, until it's fully ingrained in my memory. I might be ready to wake up and work on it right there. This process can take a whole day or more. (2) Asking logical, systematic, and non-random questions, frequently.
- I don't enjoy encountering old bugs. New bugs provide me with a natural source of dopamine. `assert` and `raise` are our friends.
- Lots of minor engineering problems must be rapidly solved in an algorithmic way, thus contributing to good research.
- Backpropagation and transformer are general ‚ù§Ô∏è. I like general things. (**inductive prior** will set a starting point until your model gets informed by your data, while the **inductive bias** inevitability limits the space of possible model-solutions)
- Why? or Why is it important? So what?
